## Secure Data Hiding in Image using Steganography

#### Steganography:
‚Ä¢A steganography technique involves hiding¬†sensitive¬†information within an ordinary, non-secret file or message, so that it will not be detected.
‚Ä¢The sensitive information will then be extracted from the ordinary file or message at its destination, thus avoiding detection.

#### About:
